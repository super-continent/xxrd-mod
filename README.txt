-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW MOVES/CHARACTER CHANGES:

Sol:
-236H in the air is now sidewinder, has a clean hit spacing
-Grand Viper is now similar to the XX version
-236D in the air is a force break sidewinder, always clean hits
-Fafnir>D is now a force break similar to the one in XX, slightly more untechable time than 632146H but less damage

Ky:
-623H/S>D is now a force break similar to Lightning Javelin, followup may only be used on hit
gives wallbounce and sets up for a grinder charged stunedge midscreen
-214D is now a force break that puts out a multi-hit grinder, similar to Jins snowflake in Blazblue
-Kys DP now has a very slight amount of forced proration to make up for the large amount of damage you could get off FB followup corner routes

Johnny:
-All grounded Mist Finers are now similar to their #RELOAD variants except for level 3, which is unchanged
-214H is now an upward thrown coin, similar to +R
-236D is now a force break similar to jackhound
-623D in the air is now a force break similar to Killer Joker, refreshes all air options and has 0 frames of recovery on hit
-6K is now special cancelable on hit (he needs it)

Bedman:
-236D is now a force break that functions as a much stronger version of his Revelator 6H
-214D is now a force break that activates all Deja Vu ghosts at the same time
-2H now has much less recovery time on whiff
-Buffer time for attacking out of airdash has been reduced from 16 to 10 frames
this was to fix a bug that caused bedman to do jP out of every FRC>Airdash that was done within a certain window

Raven:
-236D on the ground is now a force break that functions as Scratch with much less recovery time, allowing for small confirms off of it midscreen
-236D in the air is now a force break that shoots 3 needle projectiles, covering most space on the screen

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FRC POINTS:

Many FRC points I made sure to have an audible cue for to make the timing feel more natural
The windows for FRC are also much wider to make it feel consistent for players who arent used to it

NOTE: FRCs replace the normal RC system, RRC is currently reimplemented as a special move and is added as a gatling option to specials that need it

Sol:
-Bandit Revolver FRC immediately, works in air
-Bandit Bringer FRC as soon as the fire effect appears
-Gunflame FRC as soon as the projectile comes out
-Kudakero FRC as soon as sol starts traveling downward
-Riot Stamp FRC as soon as Sol begins traveling forward from the wall
-Fafnir FRC a couple frames before the move hits (dont blame me for this one, it was left over and i thought it was fun)

Ky:
-Stun Edge FRC immediately when the projectile comes out, works with 236H as well
-Stun Dipper FRC as soon as the 2nd hit becomes active

Johnny:
-Zwei FRC as soon as the projectile comes out
-Bacchus Sigh FRC as soon as the mist appears and the higher-pitched sound plays

Bedman:
-Task A FRC as soon as the projectile comes out
-Ground Task B FRC when the move starts recovering
-Air Task B FRC immediately when the move starts gaining momentum
-Ground and air Task C FRC when bedman begins falling downward
-Deja Vu FRC immediately as the ghost is/would be summoned

Raven:
-Needle FRC as soon as the projectile comes out
-Scharf Kugel FRC as soon as the ball appears
-Armor Dance FRC throughout the entirety of the animation (unless you hold it for longer than 2,147,483,647 frames)
